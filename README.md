SIRL is an app designed to make grocery shopping easier and more efficient

By adding ingredients along with their location in one or more stores, 
it allows the user to quickly and easily generate a grocery list for a selected set of recipes,
in any user defined order, which means less time spent wandering the aisles of the grocery store.
